# ruuvi_node_test
Test(?) server for listening for ruuviTag temperature data and serving that as a graph image. Not in any way finished or even well thought out. Will be taken apart later on so we will have a server that is responsible for listening the output data (running on raspberry pie) and a cloud-hosted service that serves a nice graph, for example netlify backed by Firebase storage.
